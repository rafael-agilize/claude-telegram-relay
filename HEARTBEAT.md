# Heartbeat Checklist

Check these items on each heartbeat cycle. Report anything noteworthy.
If everything is normal, respond with HEARTBEAT_OK.

## What to Check

- Check if there are any pending reminders or follow-ups I should know about
- Check the current time and whether any time-sensitive items need attention
- Look for any patterns in our recent conversations that suggest something I should be reminded about

## When to Report

Report when:
- A reminder or deadline is approaching
- Something changed that the user should know about
- You notice something that needs the user's attention

Stay silent (HEARTBEAT_OK) when:
- Everything is routine and nothing needs attention
- No deadlines or reminders are pending
- There's nothing actionable to communicate
